# Blink-count-

The project uses computer vision techniques to detect facial collisions using the FaceMesh module. The script captures live video from the camera, detects facial landmarks, and calculates eye movements. If a blink is detected, the code increments the blink counter and triggers a text-to-speech announcement of the current blink rate.

# Key Features:

FaceMesh detection for facial landmarks.
Real-time blink counting with a visual indicator.
Integration of text-to-speech for audio announcements.
Adjustable speech rate for user preference.

# How to Use:

Run the code in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.
Ensure your camera is accessible.
Open and close your eyes to trigger blink detection.
The script will announce the blink count in real-time.


##### Feel free to test with the code and customize it to suit your possibilities. Adjust the speech charge or explore extra functions to decorate the task similarly.
